# Titanic_Tutorial
This project uses one of Kaggle's most popular datasets to implement and compare various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to select the algorithm with the highest accuracy and then fine-tune the model.
The project consists the following sections:
* Load libraries.
* Read the data.
* Explore the data.
* Visualization.
* Data preprocessing.
* Feature engineering.
* Model Selection.
### Problem Description
