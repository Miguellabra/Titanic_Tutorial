# Titanic_Tutorial
This project uses one of Kaggle's most popular datasets to implement and compare various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to select the algorithm with the highest accuracy and then fine-tune the model.
The project consists of the following sections:
* Load libraries.
* Read the data.
* Explore the data.
* Visualization.
* Data preprocessing.
* Feature engineering.
* Model Selection.
## Problem Description
The main objective in this problem is to predict whether a passenger will survive to the titanic catastrophe based on some features like sex, age, cabin, embarked, among others. In this problem the submission file should most be a two column dataset, one containing the passenger ID and the other must have 1 or 0, depending on if the passenger didnÂ´t survived 0 and 1 if the passenger survived.
## The approach
This project considers two ways to tackle the problem. The first, data focused aproach, meaning that I ensure the quality of data, reason why I consider 4 data categories. And the model focused approach; after creating 4 different data categories, these data sets are proccesed by different algorithms.
